🚀 Upskill Navigator

Your all-in-one personalized learning assistant — built to guide, motivate, and upskill users efficiently through smart AI tools and gamification.

## 🧠 Overview

Upskill Navigator helps learners plan, track, and enhance their skill development journey with AI-powered guidance, real-time streaks/timers, and a synced leaderboard among participants.

## 🧩 Features

- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication (email/password)
- **AI Chatbot**: Gemini (2.5 Flash) via a dev-only Vite proxy at `POST /api/chat`
- **Leaderboard**: Ranks participants (`users.isParticipant==true`) by total points; weekly points from recent quiz scores
- **Quizzes**: Writes `scores` and adds user points; marks users as participants
- **Streaks**: Current and best streak computed from `logins/{uid}/days`
- **Screen Time**: Live per-day timer shared across Home and Streak (`screenTime/{uid}/days/{YYYY-MM-DD}`)
- **Doubt Solver**: Create doubts, AI-generated answers, status and resolved filtering

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS + Vite
- Backend: Firebase (Auth, Firestore)
- AI: Google Gemini (2.5 Flash)
- Hosting: Vercel/Firebase Hosting (dev proxy is Vite-only)
- Database: Firestore

## 🔧 Environment

Create a `.env` in project root:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_KEY
```

Notes:
- The Vite dev server reads `.env` on startup. Restart after changes.
- The `/api/chat` proxy is available only in `npm run dev`. For production, add a serverless function (Netlify/Vercel/Firebase) and point the client to it.

## ▶️ Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Visit the Chatbot page and ask something to test Gemini.
- Take a Quiz to generate `scores` and points; you’ll appear on the leaderboard.
- Use Streak page to “Mark Today” and see streak/best-streak on Home.
- Start/Stop the Screen Time timer on Home or Streak and see values sync.
- Submit a doubt in Doubt Solver; an AI answer will be added automatically.

## 🗂️ Firestore Collections (per user where applicable)

- `users/{uid}`: `{ totalPoints: number, isParticipant: boolean, displayName?, photoURL? }`
- `scores/{autoId}`: `{ uid, score, subject, createdAt }` (weekly points derive from last 7 days)
- `logins/{uid}/days/{YYYY-MM-DD}`: `{ active: true, at }`
- `streaks/{uid}`: `{ streak, lastActive, updatedAt }`
- `screenTime/{uid}/days/{YYYY-MM-DD}`: `{ totalMs, running, lastStart, updatedAt }`
- `doubts/{uid}/items/{autoId}`: `{ question, answer, status: 'pending'|'answered'|'error', resolved, createdAt, updatedAt }`

Ensure your Firestore rules allow authenticated users to read/write their own documents under these paths.

## 🚀 Production note

- Replace the Vite dev proxy with a serverless function for `/api/chat` and configure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as a server-side secret.
